Methods
All current consultants identified from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) database were sent a single page questionnaire with a covering letter and prepaid response envelope. The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions aimed at determining current practise for the laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of women with pelvic pain due to endometriosis. Recipients were randomised to receive a questionnaire containing a covering letter offering the incentive of entry to a prize draw to win a personal digital assistant (PDA) or no incentive. A prominent gynaecological device manufacturer provided the PDA and this was acknowledged in the covering letter of those randomised to receive the incentive.
The randomisation sequence was computer generated and group allocation was concealed from the participants and investigators throughout the study. One reminder was sent to non-responders three months after the original with the same incentive according to prior randomisation. Based on the response rate from a previous gynaecological questionnaire [5] we assumed that inclusion of a prize draw incentive would increase the proportion of responders by 10% from 60% to 70%. This meant that the sample size (1410) had 95 % power (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.05). Relative response rates were calculated and statistical significance tested for a difference between proportions (independent observation) responding.
