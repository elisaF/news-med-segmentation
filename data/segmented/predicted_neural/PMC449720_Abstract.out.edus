Background
Response rates to postal questionnaires are falling
and this threatens the external validity of survey findings .
We wanted to establish
whether the incentive
of being entered into a prize draw
to win a personal digital assistant
( PDA )
would increase the response rate for a national survey of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists .
Methods
A randomised controlled trial was conducted .
This involved sending a postal questionnaire to all Consultant Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the United Kingdom .
Recipients were randomised
to receiving a questionnaire
offering a prize draw incentive
( on response )
or no such incentive .
Results
The response rate for recipients
offered the prize incentive
was 64 %
( 461/716 )
and 62 % ( 429/694 )
in the no incentive group
( relative rate of response 1.04 , 95 % CI 0.96 â€“ 1.13 )
Conclusion
The offer of a prize draw incentive
to win a PDA
did not significantly increase response rates to a national questionnaire survey of consultant obstetricians and gynaecologists .
