DISCUSSION In this 15-centre , 6-week , parallel group , randomized controlled trial EDU_BREAK conducted in Indian outpatients with major depressive disorder EDU_BREAK that was at least moderate in severity , EDU_BREAK PB was as effective as sertraline EDU_BREAK in attenuating depression rating scores on the HAM-D and MADRS .
Statistically significant improvement in HAM-D and MADRS scores were evident at the end of 2 weeks of treatment , itself .
The response EDU_BREAK -LRB- 90 % -RRB- EDU_BREAK and remission EDU_BREAK -LRB- 70 % -RRB- EDU_BREAK rates with PB were high , EDU_BREAK and were comparable with those EDU_BREAK achieved with sertraline EDU_BREAK -LRB- 92 % and 75 % , respectively -RRB- .
PB was very well tolerated EDU_BREAK and was associated with significantly less nausea and headache than sertraline ; EDU_BREAK in contrast , no adverse event occurred at a greater frequency with PB relative to sertraline .
PB did not adversely affect heart rate , blood pressure , hematological measures , biochemical measures , metabolic measures , and the EKG .
These data confirm in Indian patients the favorable results EDU_BREAK obtained for PB in the Phase III regulatory trials EDU_BREAK conducted in the North American and European continents . -LSB- 8 EDU_BREAK -- 11 -RSB- EDU_BREAK The recommended dosing range of PB is 75-300 mg/day , as identified in the Phase III clinical trials . -LSB- 8 EDU_BREAK -- 11 -RSB- EDU_BREAK It is noteworthy EDU_BREAK that , in this Indian study , the mean endpoint dose was 250 mg/day EDU_BREAK ; EDU_BREAK that is , EDU_BREAK towards the higher end of the dosing range .
Despite the administration of these higher doses , PB was tolerated as well as or better than sertraline .
PB therefore appears to be a useful addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of major depressive disorder in Indian patients .
