Background Postal surveys are commonly used in medical research as an efficient method EDU_BREAK of obtaining information about medical practitioners attributes , behaviours , attitudes and beliefs .
There is evidence EDU_BREAK that response rates to surveys are declining in general practice EDU_BREAK -LSB- 1 -RSB- EDU_BREAK and this trend may also be reflected in hospital EDU_BREAK based medicine .
This is of concern EDU_BREAK as the external validity of the findings from these surveys is dependent upon adequate response rates EDU_BREAK -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
Therefore the identification of effective strategies to increase response rates is important to improve the quality and generalisability of such health research .
In two earlier randomised controlled trials , we reported no effect on the rate of response to a medical questionnaire of paper quality or provision of a complimentary pen EDU_BREAK -LSB- 2,3 -RSB- .
A recently published systematic review showed EDU_BREAK that monetary incentives doubled the odds of response in the general population .
Furthermore , it demonstrated EDU_BREAK that non-monetary incentives may also be effective in improving response rates by a smaller degree , EDU_BREAK although the effect varied EDU_BREAK according to population and type of incentive -LSB- 4 -RSB- .
In order to further test the impact of non-monetary incentives on survey response by medical professionals , EDU_BREAK we hypothesised EDU_BREAK that entry into a prize draw to win EDU_BREAK a personal digital assistant EDU_BREAK -LRB- PDA -RRB- EDU_BREAK would increase response to a survey of practising obstetricians and gynaecologists .
