Methods All current consultants EDU_BREAK identified from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists EDU_BREAK -LRB- RCOG -RRB- database EDU_BREAK were sent a single page questionnaire with a covering letter and prepaid response envelope .
The questionnaire consisted of 10 questions EDU_BREAK aimed at determining current practise for the laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment of women with pelvic pain due to endometriosis .
Recipients were randomised EDU_BREAK to receive a questionnaire EDU_BREAK containing a covering letter EDU_BREAK offering the incentive of entry to a prize draw EDU_BREAK to win a personal digital assistant EDU_BREAK -LRB- PDA -RRB- or no incentive .
A prominent gynaecological device manufacturer provided EDU_BREAK the PDA and this was acknowledged in the covering letter of those EDU_BREAK randomised to receive the incentive .
The randomisation sequence was computer generated EDU_BREAK and group allocation was concealed from the participants and investigators throughout the study .
One reminder was sent to non-responders three months after the original with the same incentive EDU_BREAK according to prior randomisation .
Based on the response rate from a previous gynaecological questionnaire EDU_BREAK -LSB- 5 -RSB- we assumed EDU_BREAK that inclusion of a prize draw incentive would increase the proportion of responders by 10 % from 60 % to 70 % .
This meant EDU_BREAK that the sample size EDU_BREAK -LRB- 1410 -RRB- EDU_BREAK had 95 % power EDU_BREAK -LRB- alpha = 0.05 , EDU_BREAK beta = 0.05 -RRB- .
Relative response rates were calculated EDU_BREAK and statistical significance tested for a difference between proportions EDU_BREAK -LRB- independent observation -RRB- EDU_BREAK responding .
